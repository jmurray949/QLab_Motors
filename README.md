Simulation of a wheeled robot and a motor 

Currently have the simulation for the wheeled robot - may need some little tweaks

Motor simulation and code needs a bit of work. Currently Unity is having a fit every time I run the code

Should simulate the following:
-When the motor overheats
-When the torque is too high
-When the motor force is too high
-If too high the motor should either slow down, reverse, or stop completely.
